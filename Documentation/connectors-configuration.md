# Configuring Connectors

Connectors connect dex to authentication providers. dex needs to have at least one connector configured so that users can log in.

## Configuration Format

The dex connector configuration format is a JSON array of objects, each with an ID and type, in addition to whatever other configuration is required, like so:

```
[
    {
        "id": "local",
        "type": "local"
    }, {
        "id": "Google",
        "type": "oidc",
        ...<<more config>>...
    } 
]
```

The additional configuration is dependent on the specific type of connector.

### `local` connector

The `local` connector allows email/password based authentication hosted by dex itself. It is special in several ways:

* There can only be one `local` connector in your configuration.
* The id must be `local`
* No other configuration is required

When the `local` connector is present, users can authenticate with the "Log in With Email" button on the authentication screen.

The configuration for the local connector is always the same; it looks like this:

```
    {
        "id": "local",
        "type": "local"
    }
```

### `oidc` connector

This connector config lets users authenticate with other OIDC providers. In addition to `id` and `type`, the `oidc` connector takes the following additional fields:

* issuerURL: a `string`. The base URL for the OIDC provider. Should be a URL with an `https` scheme.

* clientID: a `string`. The OIDC client ID.

* clientSecret: a `string`. The OIDC client secret.

* trustedEmailProvider: a `boolean`. If true dex will trust the email address claims from this provider and not require that users verify their emails.

* domain: a `string` (optional).  If set, users' email address domain must match the provided value. Email addresses that do not match will not be allowed to register or log in with dex. For example, if domain is set to example.com, the email address user@example.com will be granted an identity token, but user@example.net will not.

In order to use the `oidc` connector you must register dex as an OIDC client; this mechanism is different from provider to provider. For Google, follow the instructions at their [developer site](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect?hl=en). Regardless of your provider, registering your client will also provide you with the client ID and secret.

When registering dex as a client, you need to provide redirect URLs to the provider. dex requires just one:

```
https://$DEX_HOST:$DEX_PORT/auth/$CONNECTOR_ID/callback
```

`$DEX_HOST` and `$DEX_PORT` are the host and port of your dex installation. `$CONNECTOR_ID` is the `id` field of the connector for this OIDC provider.

Here's what a `oidc` connector looks like configured for authenticating with Google; the clientID and clientSecret shown are not usable. We consider Google a trusted email provider because the email address that is present in claims is for a Google provisioned email account (eg. an `@gmail.com` address)

```
    {
        "type": "oidc",
        "id": "google",
        "issuerURL": "https://accounts.google.com",
        "clientID": "$DEX_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID",
        "clientSecret": "$DEX_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET",
        "trustedEmailProvider": true
    }
```

### `github` connector

This connector config lets users authenticate through [GitHub](https://github.com/). In addition to `id` and `type`, the `github` connector takes the following additional fields:

* clientID: a `string`. The GitHub OAuth application client ID.

* clientSecret: a `string`. The GitHub OAuth application client secret.

To begin, register an OAuth application with GitHub through your, or your organization's [account settings](ttps://github.com/settings/applications/new). To register dex as a client of your GitHub application, enter dex's redirect URL under 'Authorization callback URL':

```
https://$DEX_HOST:$DEX_PORT/auth/$CONNECTOR_ID/callback
```

`$DEX_HOST` and `$DEX_PORT` are the host and port of your dex installation. `$CONNECTOR_ID` is the `id` field of the connector.

Here's an example of a `github` connector; the clientID and clientSecret should be replaced by values provided by GitHub.

```
    {
        "type": "github",
        "id": "github",
        "clientID": "$DEX_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID",
        "clientSecret": "$DEX_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET"
    }
```

The `github` connector requests read only access to user's email through the [`user:email` scope](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes).

### `bitbucket` connector

This connector config lets users authenticate through [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/). In addition to `id` and `type`, the `bitbucket` connector takes the following additional fields:

* clientID: a `string`. The Bitbucket OAuth consumer client ID.

* clientSecret: a `string`. The Bitbucket OAuth consumer client secret.

To begin, register an OAuth consumer with Bitbucket through your, or your teams's management page. Follow the documentation at their [developer site](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/oauth-on-bitbucket-cloud-238027431.html). 
__NOTE:__ When configuring a consumer through Bitbucket you _must_ configure read email permissions.

To register dex as a client of your Bitbucket consumer, enter dex's redirect URL under 'Callback URL':

```
https://$DEX_HOST:$DEX_PORT/auth/$CONNECTOR_ID/callback
```

`$DEX_HOST` and `$DEX_PORT` are the host and port of your dex installation. `$CONNECTOR_ID` is the `id` field of the connector.

Here's an example of a `bitbucket` connector; the clientID and clientSecret should be replaced by values provided by Bitbucket.

```
    {
        "type": "bitbucket",
        "id": "bitbucket",
        "clientID": "$DEX_BITBUCKET_CLIENT_ID",
        "clientSecret": "$DEX_BITBUCKET_CLIENT_SECRET"
    }
```

## Setting the Configuration

To set a connectors configuration in dex, put it in some temporary file, then use the dexctl command to upload it to dex:

```
dexctl -db-url=$DEX_DB_URL set-connector-configs /tmp/dex_connectors.json
```
